NIMS: Neurobiological Image Management System
=============================================

NIMS is a scientific data management system, specifically designed for neuroimaging data. It is implemented in Python, based on TurboGears. NIMS is open-source software, released under the MIT license (see below for details).


NIMS Development on Ubuntu
--------------------------

Set up a virtual python environment:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools python-virtualenv
    virtualenv --no-site-packages tg2
    cd tg2
    source bin/activate

Install iPython and the TurboGears development tools:

    easy_install ipython readline
    easy_install -i http://tg.gy/current/index/ tg.devtools

Clone NIMS from GitHub and install its dependencies:

    git clone git@github.com:cni/nims.git
    cd nims
    python setup.py develop

Optionally, add PostgreSQL and LDAP support:

    sudo apt-get install libpq-dev postgresql-common
    easy_install psycopg2

    sudo apt-get install libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev
    easy_install python-ldap

Generate a development database and start the paste web server:

    paster setup-app development.ini
    paster serve --reload development.ini


NIMS Deployment on FreeBSD and Apache
-------------------------------------

Set up a virtual python environment:

    mkdir /usr/local/pythonenv
    virtualenv --no-site-packages /usr/local/pythonenv/tg2
    source /usr/local/pythonenv/tg2/bin/activate

Clone NIMS from GitHub and install its dependencies:

    easy_install -i http://tg.gy/current/index/ TurboGears2
    cd /usr/local/www/apache22
    git clone git://github.com/cni/nims.git
    cd nims
    python setup.py develop

Add PostgreSQL and LDAP support:

    portmaster databases/postgresql84-client net/py-ldap2
    easy_install psycopg2
    CPATH=/usr/local/include:/usr/local/include/sasl LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib easy_install python-ldap

Configure and restart Apache:

    ln -s $PWD/nims/apache.conf /usr/local/etc/apache22/Includes/nims.conf
    /usr/local/etc/rc.d/apache22 restart
